1.
The cost of block nested loop join is much less than that of the nested loop join.
By using join buffer, BNL stores multiple tuples of outer join realtion before comparation. And NLJ has to access the inner join block every time it access a tuple in the outer join block. Therefore, the times of accessing inner join block are significantly saved thus reducing the cost much.

failed.
But I think the farther the select node is from root of the querry tree, the cost of querry will be reduced more. It's better to do select before join.

3.
Example: Indexed nested inner join
Assume A is the attribute that the R and S have in common. For every tuple in R, we use the the value of R.A to search corresponding attributes of S.(select attribute=R.A from S)

B-tree is better than B+tree in this situation.
In this method, we need to search S.A that equals to R.A. Since B+tree does better in range querry and B-tree does better in qualification querry, B-tree is better.
